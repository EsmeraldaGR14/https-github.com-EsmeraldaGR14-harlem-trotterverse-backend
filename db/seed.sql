    'Meet Hammer Harrison, the inspiring Globetrotters dunking sensation who overcame immense adversity and a late start to reach remarkable heights. Despite facing numerous injuries, including broken fingers and legs, Hammer''s determination prevailed. A five-inch growth spurt at 17 led him to embrace basketball as his passion, excelling at Sullivan Community College and later at Hampton University. Known for his long trick shots, he holds the Guinness World Record for the longest underhand basketball shot. Beyond sports, Hammer is an accomplished computer graphics professional with dreams of owning his design studio. He thrives on the adrenaline rush of extreme sports like bungee jumping and skydiving, adding to his impressive repertoire. As a Globetrotter, he has traveled extensively, made TV appearances, and participated in unique events, showcasing his versatile talents and indomitable spirit.',

    'A tenacious baller, Bulldog brings grit and grind to the Globetrotters’ shine. Like many other children growing up with older siblings, Bulldog looked up to his older brother Chris, who taught him the ropes in the hoops world and was a Harlem Globetrotter before Bulldog. When Chris passed away during Bulldog’s junior year of high school, it inspired Bulldog to become the baller he is. As one of the big men on the Globetrotters, Bulldog rocks the rim with ferocity and grabs boards like a fiend. And while his on-court tenacity projects a fierceness, Bulldog is a giver at heart. He regularly works with the YMCA, where he balled as a kid, and with the Boys and Girls Club. Bulldog loves working with kids just as much as he loves scouting out cities for trick shots, such as the legendary Liberty City trick shot, where he made a long-distance shot off a bridge. And, of course, being a Harlem Globetrotter has its perks, as Bulldog and his teammates get to travel the U.S. and the world. Bulldog takes full advantage of that as the team’s resident foodie, finding out-of-the-way places (no chain restaurants), to have delicious food while on tour.

    'While Thor might have created thunder and lightning, Harlem Globetrotter Thunder Law brings the modern-day hammer every time he dunks. A high-flyer with a healthy disregard for gravity, Thunder has the hops to touch the sky and the power to rattle the rim every time he steps on the court. While you would be forgiven for thinking Thunder only means power, in this case, he also brings touch and aim as a master of several long-distance trick shots. Thunder has been a record-breaking machine since landing with the Globetrotters, currently owning 11 Guinness World Records titles. Thunder’s magnetic personality has translated to off-court notability, with appearances on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “Rachel Ray,” Nickelodeon’s “Mutt & Stuff” and “Ryan’s Mystery Playdate,” and ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” All of this media fun has led him to start taking acting lessons recently. While Allen Iverson was his favorite player growing up (he is from Virginia after all), he grew to respect Kobe Bryant, especially because Thunder is a fellow Girl Dad, and relishes the time he spends with his daughters. Now he is living his dream as a central part of the Harlem Globetrotters’ high-flying brand of family entertainment.',
